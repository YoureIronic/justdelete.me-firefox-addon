## How to build

This add-on uses [Mozilla's Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK). Download that and [install it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation) accordingly.

When you have installed the Add-on SDK you need to add the dependencies for this add-on. We need the [Urlbar Button module](https://github.com/voxpelli/moz-urlbarbutton) and the [ShowForPage module](https://github.com/voxpelli/moz-showforpage) so download those and add it to a packages/-folder within this addon - this is the way you add [third party modules](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/tutorials/adding-menus.html) that an add-on uses.

Once you have added the dependency you can [download this add-on](https://github.com/alaouy/justdelete.me-firefox-addon) itself and run it and build it the way you like. Check the Add-on SDK [Getting Started tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials) to find out how that is done.
